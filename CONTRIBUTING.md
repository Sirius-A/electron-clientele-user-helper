## Guidelines

### Workflow

We use the
[Feature Branch Workflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/feature-branch-workflow)
and review all changes we merge to master.

### Commit Message

Commit messages should follow the conventions defined by [conventional-changelog](https://wiki.siemens.com/display/en/Conventional+Changelog).

> **HINT**: A good way to create commit messages is by using the tool `git gui`.
